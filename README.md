solving the Pacman game with Q-learning

# Introduction
In this project, we will learn how to solve the Pacman game with Q-learning. In this problem, an environment is given to the program. The environment consists of Agents, Dots, Walls, and Ghosts(Adding ghosts will have bonus points and it is optional). To discretize and digitize the roads, we convert them into small unit squares. The starting point of the agentâ€™s movement is also determined. The goal is to collect all the Dots in the environment without touching any Ghosts(Of course you can not pass the walls). In the figure below, the ghosts are marked in red. W stands for wall, A stands for Agent, D stands for Dot, G stands for Ghost, and E for empty cell(A cell becomes empty after the agent collects the dot).
